# LinkedIn_Friends (Currently under serious building and fixing to make it faster and more dependless).

This script allows you to add friends automatically on linkedIn. 


Instructions:

`pip install selenium`

`pip install pyautogui==0.9.50`

Edit your credentials, and friends amount at the setting file.


# Warning:
At first run, it may need you to press the `'Continue with Mobile version'` button (Will be fixed soon).
